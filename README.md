Software-based "jailbreak" allowing all ivybridge-based xx30 thinkpads to softmod custom bios images.

This repo contains the main script and pre-compiled binary files used in the 1vyrain image to flash machines.

The main link to the ready to go live USB image can be found [here](https://n4ru.it/1vyrain/).

Updates will be published here in the form of scripts that can be downloaded and ran on the USB image.

# Features:
- Automatic exploit chain unlocking bios region for flashing
- Model detection and automatic bios flashing
- Support for custom bios images (coreboot, skulls, heads)

# BIOS Mod Features:
- Overclocking support (37xx, 38xx, 39xx CPUs)
- Whitelist removal to use any WLAN adapter
- Advanced menu (custom fan curve, TDP, core disable, etc)
- Intel ME disablement via advanced menu

This was a monumental amount of work to put together and release, and took a lot of time.
